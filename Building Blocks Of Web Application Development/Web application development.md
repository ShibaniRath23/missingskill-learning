## 1.**Software languages**
    > Software is a set of instructions,data,or programs used to operate a computer system and execute specific tasks.

## Here is a list of Software Programming Language..
* Python
* JavaScript
* Java
* C#
* C
* C++
* GO
* R
* Swift
* Dart
* Kotlin
* Ruby
* PHP
* Dart
* COBOL

## 2.**IP Address**
     IP stands for Internet Protocol.It is an unique address that identifies a device on the internet.
### versions of IP
    1.IPV4
    2.IPV6
### Classification of IP

|CLASS|  RANGE   |Used For |
|-----|----------|---------|
|A    |0   TO 127| Local system |
|B    |128 TO 191| Internet |
|C    |192 TO 223|Local Network |
|D    |224 TO 239| Not used/Reserved |
|E    |240 TO 255| Not used |

## 3.**Web Ports**
      Ports are virtual point where network connections start and end.There are total 65,535 port numbers available.
###
|Port               |Description                 |  
|-------------------|-------------------         |      
|   0  to    1023   | Reserved port used by system|  
|1024  to    49151  | Application port            |  
|49152 to    65535  | Open port                   | 
 


## 4.**HTTP & HTTPS**
   Ports 80 and 443 are standard HTTP and HTTPS ports.

### HTTP Verbs
* GET  - used to retrieve data from a server.
* POST - used to send data to the server
*  PUT  - uesd to send data to the server to update a resource.
*  DELETE-used to delete the data.
* OPTION-It describes the communication optionsfor the target resource.
* HEAD- It is almost identical to get, but without the response body.

### HTTP Headers
   HTTP Headers are used to pass information between clients and server through the request and 
   response header.

### HTTP status code
    It is  the response from  server to the clients.

|Code Range|Description(status)|
|-----------|-----------|
|0-100| Informational response|
|200-299| Success responses|
|300-399| Redirect responses| 
|400-499| Client error responses|
|500-599 |Server error responses|

## 5.**Software License**
* Apache 2.0
* MIT
* GPL
* BSD
* Mozilla

## 6.**Database**
 ### **I.Relational**
* MY SQL
* Postgre SQL
* Maria DB
 ### **II.Non-Relatonal**
 * MongoDB
 * Redis
 * Cassandra
 * NeoJS
 ### **III.Cloud Providers(SAAS ,PAAS ,IAAS)**
 * AWS
 * GOOGLE CLOUD
 * BLUE MIX
 * Digital Ocean
 * Vultr
 * inode
 * Heruko
 * Azure
 * Netlify

## 7.**Code Repository**

* GITHub
* GITLab
* Bitbucket
### **Dev Workflow (Git)**

   * feature branch
   * develop branch
   * stage branch
   * master branch(Deploy to production)
### **Infrastructure**

   * Dev(Development)
   * UAT(user acceptance test)/Staging(for Devops)
   * Production System(for Devops)
## 8.**Domain & Hosting**
 A domain is the unique name of a website. Hosting is also known as web hosting.Web hosting is an online service that enables you to publish your website or web application on the internet.
